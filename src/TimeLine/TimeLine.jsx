          I recently have joined the Juniper Networs as a Software
          Developer-Intern in the DevOps team. My major part of the work has

          (Continuous Integration & Continuous Development) pipelines which
          enables developers at Juniper to do rapid development. I am also
          exploring the role of container technology like Docker and
          container-orchrastation technologies like K8s, Swarm to create
          industry standard production environments.
